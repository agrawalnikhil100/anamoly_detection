# Anamoly Detection 

The course available at courseera for Machine Learning by Andrew Ng is on Matlab. This repository has codes in python for the exercise.

The algorithm first fits a multivariate gaussian distribution to the multi-dimensional data. Then it calculates PDF for each data point. The points whose probability is very low is flagged as anomalous data and requires further qualitative investigation.
